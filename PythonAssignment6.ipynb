        "Define Object Oriented Programming Language? Answer: Object Oriented Programming Language refers to a type of computer programming in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations that can be applied to the data structure. It help to reduce the complexity and also improve the maintainability of the system. When combined with the concepts of the Encapsulation and Polymorphism, Abstraction gives more power to the OPP languages."

Objects can also be reused within an across apllications. The resue of software also lowers the cost of development."
